# LaTeX-template

LaTeX project template repository. Pulls and builds to a fully-equipped, VS Code-compatible Docker container, based on the [`LaTeX Workshop`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshops) extension.

This is intended to be the starting configuration of any LaTeX project.

By default, build files and output will be located in the `build` folder.
